Google Summer of Code is a yearly program offering students stipends to write code for Open Source projects. Students can choose one of many mentoring organizations to work for. MacPorts is taking place in the program since 2007 and has been accepted once again for 2011!

You may apply to work on MacPorts for this summer and get $5000 USD as compensation. There is no requirement for any contribution to MacPorts or other Open Source projects before, it is only expected that you show us the motivation to work on your task.

Each organizations provides experienced mentors to discuss your task beforehand and will give you advice during implementation. This is a great opportunity to start into Open Source development.

We have a list of ideas with possible tasks for MacPorts and additional information about the application process:

Of course we are also open to any ideas you might bring up. In any case, get in [contact](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/MailingLists) with us and discuss your proposal with us before handing in the application.
