It's been long since we last publicly announced new team members, and as a result some of them have gone without their deserved welcoming posts, sorry 'bout that. It's been so long that I couldn't possibly remember which ones were the last publicly announced ones, so rather than sifting through our list of members and older blog posts I'll just post the entire list itself:

Feel like you want to be in it…? Great, we're always looking for more helping hands! Shape up and browse over to <https://www.macports.org/contact.php#PortMgr>
