The MacPorts Project is pleased to announce the release of version
2.6.2. This is a bugfix release with small changes only. See the
[ChangeLog][1] for the list of changes.

If you already have MacPorts installed, the preferred method for
updating is to run:

    sudo port selfupdate

For new installs, [package installers][2] are available for the most current
macOS 10.15 Catalina and all older releases back to Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. The
source is also available as tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2, or from the
[git tag][3].

Detached PGP signatures for the disk images, package installers and
source tarballs have been made by [Joshua Root][4], and the git tag has
been signed with the same key. The public key is available on the
keyservers and the MacPorts wiki, the fingerprint being:

0x01FF673FB4AAE6CD: C403 7936 5723 6DCF 2E58  0C02 01FF 673F B4AA E6CD
