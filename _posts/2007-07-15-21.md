The MacPorts team is pleased to announce the release of MacPorts v1.5.

A major achievement in this release is the completion of code and documentation changes to reflect the transition in project name from DarwinPorts to MacPorts. This results in a slightly modified installation layout.

In addition to that, there are a sizable number of bug fixes and feature enhancements.

Please see the [release notes](https://trac.macosforge.org/projects/macports/browser/tags/release_1_5_0/base/ChangeLog) for more details.

Mac OS X v10.3 and 10.4 [downloads are available](https://svn.macports.org/repository/macports/downloads/MacPorts-1.5.0/).
