Many people have asked us if there is a way to contribute to MacPorts
financially. We are happy to announce that we are now able to accept
contributions via the Open Collective platform, with The Open Source
Collective as our fiscal host. [Click here to get started.][1]

We also have a [GitHub Sponsors profile][2],
which may be more convenient for some people to use. Payments made
through GitHub Sponsors also go to our Open Collective account.

Open Collective has extensive documentation explaining how the system
works. The [Contributors FAQ][3] is a good place to start.

The collected funds will be used to cover expenses related to the
operation of the MacPorts project. Expenses will be approved at the
discretion of the PortMgr team. Transactions will be publicly visible
on the Open Collective site (with personal information redacted).

We expect that initial expenses will be for hosting costs, with new
BuildBot hardware being a more ambitious goal. Please feel free to
suggest anything else that you think would be useful!
