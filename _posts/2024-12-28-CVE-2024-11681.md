title: Security issue in MacPorts 2.10.4 and older
slug: CVE-2024-11681
date: 2024-12-28 15:32:57
---

MacPorts versions 2.10.4 and older contain a vulnerability that can
allow a compromised rsync mirror to add Portfiles to the synced ports
tree, thus allowing arbitrary code to be executed when those Portfiles
are parsed. (Note that we currently have no reason to believe that any
of our mirrors have been compromised.)

The [fix][1] for this issue is included in versions 2.10.5 and later.
We recommend that all users running an affected version upgrade as soon
as possible.

Full details are available [here][2]. Thanks to Simon Scannell of
Google's Cloud Vulnerability Research team for discovering and
analysing the issue.
