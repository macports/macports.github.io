Source code and pkgs for MacPorts 2.5.0-beta1 are now
[available][1]. Testing of either of these install methods is helpful.

Be prepared to encounter bugs. As always, having a recent backup would
be wise. Please [report][2] any bugs that you find (after first [searching
Trac][3], of course!)

There are a large number of changes in this release. See the [ChangeLog][4]
for a list of most of the major ones. You may like to focus your
testing on the new features in that list, as well as your normal usage.
