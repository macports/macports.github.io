The MacPorts source code has been moved to [GitHub][github-org]. See [the announcement email][announcement] for this change. We have a list of [frequently asked questions][migration-faq] for the migration.

Please continue to use [Trac][trac] to report tickets. Note that our Trac now uses GitHub for login. Any tickets you have previously filed in Trac will automatically be assigned to your new account if you have the email address you used in the old MacPorts Trac configured in your GitHub account. See our [FAQ entry][migration-faq-oldtickets] on the conversion.

The MacPorts team is looking forward to your pull requests!
