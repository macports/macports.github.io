The MacPorts Project is happy to announce that the 2.5.0 version has now
been released. It is available via the usual methods:

- selfupdate if you already have MacPorts installed
- package installers for [10.13][1], [10.12][2], [10.11][3], [10.10][4], [10.9][5],
[10.8][6], [10.7][7], [10.6][8], [10.5][9] and [10.4][10] (universal i386/ppc for 10.5 and 10.4,
i386/x86\_64 for 10.6, and the rest x86\_64)
- source tarballs, both [.tar.bz2][11] and [.tar.gz][12]
- [git tag][13]

The list of what's new in 2.5.0 can be found in the [ChangeLog][14].

A big thanks to the developers for their hard work with all of the
various features and bug fixes in 2.5.0, and to all those who helped out
by reporting bugs or testing.

Detached PGP signatures for the pkg/dmgs and source tarballs have been
made by Joshua Root, whose public key is available on the keyservers and the
[MacPorts wiki][15].
