The MacPorts Project is pleased to announce the release of version
2.3.5. This is a bugfix release with small changes only, but the first
we cut from our new home at GitHub. See the [ChangeLog][1] for the list
of changes.

If you already have MacPorts installed, the preferred method for
updating is to run:

>     sudo port selfupdate

For new installs, there are also package installers available for 10.12,
10.11, 10.10, 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6, and 10.5 on [our website][2].
These installers and the source tarballs are also available from the
corresponding [v2.3.5 tag on GitHub][3].

Detached PGP signatures for the disk images and package installers have
been made by Joshua Root and the source tarballs have been signed by
Rainer Müller. Both public keys are available on the keyservers and our
MacPorts wiki pages ([jmr][4], [raimue][5]), the fingerprints being:
